# YouTube Audio RAG Pipeline

This project downloads a YouTube video, extracts and converts its audio, transcribes it with OpenAI Whisper, splits the transcript into chunks, generates embeddings, and uploads them to a Pinecone index. It includes both a command-line interface and a simple Flask web UI for running the pipeline and asking questions against your indexed content.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8 or higher** installed  
2. **Git** (optional, to clone the repository)  
3. **API keys** for:  
   - OpenAI (for Whisper transcription and embeddings)  
   - Pinecone (for your vector database)  
4. **ffmpeg** installed and on your system PATH  

---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP and unpack)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charlysegovia/youtube_audio_rag_pipeline.git
   cd youtube_audio_rag_pipeline
   ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**

   - On Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell):
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   - On Git Bash or macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/Scripts/activate    # on Windows Git Bash
     source .venv/bin/activate        # on macOS/Linux
     ```
   - On PowerShell (Windows):
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **Upgrade pip and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with these entries (no quotes):

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   PINECONE_ENV=your_pinecone_environment   # for example: us-west1-gcp
   FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0
   FLASK_PORT=3001
   FLASK_DEBUG=true
   ```

   Replace `sk-...` and the other values with your actual keys and desired settings.

## Command-Line Usage

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated and `.env` is configured.  
2. Run the pipeline with:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py <YouTube_URL> <Pinecone_Index_Name>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPrxJPZefhI my-index
   ```

3. The script will print each step to the console and will:

   - Save the video in `videos/`
   - Save the extracted audio in `audio/` as MP3
   - Save the transcript in `audio/*.txt`
   - Upload embeddings to the specified Pinecone index

---

## Web UI Usage

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python src/server.py
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3001/process`  
   - Enter the YouTube video URL  
   - Select the Pinecone index from the dropdown  
   - Click **Run Pipeline**  
   - Watch the step-by-step status updates on the page  

3. To ask questions against the indexed content, go to `http://localhost:3001/ask`  
   - Enter your query  
   - Select the same Pinecone index  
   - Click **Submit**  
   - The answer, generated by ChatGPT using your indexed chunks, will appear below

## Managing the Pinecone Index

If you switch to an embedding model with a different vector dimension (for example, `text-embedding-3-large` outputs 3072 dimensions), you must recreate your Pinecone index with the matching dimension:

## Recreate Your Pinecone Index Manually

1. Log in to your Pinecone console at https://app.pinecone.io.  
2. In the **Indexes** list, find your index (e.g. `hw5`) and click the three-dot menu next to it.  
3. Select **Delete Index**, confirm the deletion.  
4. Click **Create Index**.  
   - **Name**: enter the same index name (e.g. `hw5`)  
   - **Dimension**: set to `3072`  
   - **Metric**: choose `cosine`  
   - **Environment**: pick your Pinecone environment (e.g. `us-west1-gcp`)  
5. Click **Create**.  

Your index will now be empty and configured for 3072-dimensional vectors, so you can re-run the pipeline or use the UI without any dimension-mismatch errors.

## Notes

- Make sure the embedding model you choose matches your Pinecone index dimension.  
- Check `logs/pipeline.log` for a complete, timestamped record of each run.
